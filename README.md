# Washington Crime Tracker
A Power BI Analytics Project by Iyanu Adebara

## Overview

The Washington Crime Tracker is a multi-page Power BI report that provides a clear, data-driven view of criminal activity across Washington, D.C. Using open crime incident data, the dashboard delivers insights into daily crime trends, hotspots, offense types, key drivers, and operational patterns within the city.

This project demonstrates:

- Advanced data modeling
- Power Query transformations
- DAX measures
- Multi-page analytical storytelling
- Clean, professional dashboard UI/UX design
- Real-world crime analysis techniques

It is designed to look and function like a real internal intelligence report used by city analysts or law enforcement agencies.

## Project Structure (Pages Overview)
### Page 1 — Home Page (Crime Summary Dashboard)

A clean, minimalist executive-style overview including:

- Crime Trend (30 Days) – daily incident movement
- Crime Method Breakdown – gun, knife, others
- Total Crimes KPI – 30-day count
- Daily Offense Types – theft, assault, robbery, auto theft, homicide, etc.
- Bubble Crime Hotspots Map – geospatial visualization of crime concentration
- This page provides a fast, high-level understanding of crime patterns at a glance.

### Page 2 — Crime Factor Breakdown (Decomposition Tree)

This section breaks down the drivers of crime count by:

- Month
- Neighborhood cluster
- Method
- Block
- Day
- Responders shift

The Decomposition Tree reveals which factors most strongly contribute to incident volume.
Interactive slicers allow users to explore patterns by date or census area.

### Page 3 — Key Influencers Analysis

This page uses Power BI’s Key Influencers visual to answer operational questions such as:

“What factors increase the likelihood of incidents occurring during the MIDNIGHT shift?”

It highlights relationships between crime types, neighborhoods, and response behaviors, supporting data-driven policing and resource planning.

### Page 4 — Drill-Through Page

A detailed drill-down page that shows:

- Crime counts by day
- Neighborhood-level crime patterns
- Operational shifts
- Block-level contributions
- Month-over-month visuals

This provides investigative depth for analysts who need to explore specific incidents or geographic patterns.
